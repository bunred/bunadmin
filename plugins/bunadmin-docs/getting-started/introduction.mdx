# Introductory Tutorial

**Bunadmin** is a scaffold to quickly build a `React` background management system. It is easy to use and can help you build a powerful background management panel. Techniques that need to be familiar **only include** `Material-UI` and `Material-Table`, if you have not used it before, donâ€™t worry, you can spend very little time learning in actual use later.

Bunadmin hopes to achieve as many function reuse as possible through simple development methods, so in each bunadmin project, **common functions have been built**, such as dynamic routing, multi-level menus, **permission control, data management**, search filtering and sorting, CRUD, **file management, message notification**, documenting your code, etc. You only need to build your own plugin to call it, and the bunadmin plugin is also easy to learn and use.

*For long-term maintenance, the bunadmin core library uses TypeScript. It is also recommended that you use TypeScript to create plugins. Of course, you can still use JavaScript.*
